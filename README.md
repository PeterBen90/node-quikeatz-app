<h2>Introduction</h2>

My mother, being a chef, owns hundrends of cookbooks, but flipping through these cookbooks starts to become a lengthy and tedious process. Quik Eatz allows the user to store and manage their absolute favourite recipes that way the user can refer back to the recipes whenever hte user chooses.
